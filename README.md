# Angular GitHub Repos

Simple GitHub Repositories exercise developed with AngularJS.

Be sure you have **NodeJS**, **Bower** and **Gulp** installed.
To run the app, please follow the instructions:

1. Run npm install;
2. Run bower install;
3. Run gulp server;
4. Type http://localhost:8000/ in the browser.

If you need to download the dependencies (NodeJs, Bower and Gulp), find the links:
- NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Bower: http://bower.io/
- GulpJs: http://gulpjs.com/

If you prefer to run in your own web server, run ***gulp deploy*** and paste the content of the ***dist*** folter into your webserver website or virtual host.
The content of this folder is uglified and minified.
